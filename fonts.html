            <h3>Font Selection is important! </h3>
            <p>Choosing a typeface can be done by virtually anyoneâ€”simply click a name in a dropdown list. And yet,
                choosing
                the right typeface is one of the most deliberated decisions of the design process.

                Typography designers dedicate their careers to crafting letterforms. In those small shapes, experts
                balance
                things like emotion and neutrality, personality and practicality, legibility and flexibility. Selecting
                a
                typeface for a particular design comes with a long list of considerations.

                Traditionally, graphic designers have always studied the fundamentals of typography in terms of print
                design. But as the role of the designer now spans across all types of digital mediums, typography is a
                bigger beast to tame. In the spirit of brushing up on the fundamentals, use the web typography tips
                below
                when selecting a typeface and formatting it for the best reading experience.</p>
