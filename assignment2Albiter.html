		<h2> Image Types </h2>
<!--Questions 1 and 2 should be inside an article tag-->
	
	
	<h4> 1. What 3 main types of images are used in HTML web Pages? </h4>
			
	<p>There are three file formats for graphics used on the web: JPG, GIF, and PNG. Each of these file formats are designed with a specific purpose in mind, so it is important to understand the differences when we use them in our websites.</p>
			

	<h4> 2. When would you use each type of the 3 images? </h4>
			
	<dl>	
		<dt>JPG</dt>
	
		<dd> Its used for photographs or any type of image with smooth transitions between colors. Does not support transparency.

		The JPG image format was designed to efficiently store and compress realistic images and artwork (both in color and greyscale). The JPG format does a very good job of compressing images with lots of colors and gradations in colors. 

		When saving images in the JPG format, you can choose the level of compression to balance the file size and image quality. File size is directly related to the actual size (in pixels) of the image. A larger pixel size will always result in a larger file size.</dd>

		<dt>PNG</dt>
	
		<dd>Its used for images with flat colors and hard edges, such as logos, logotypes, and illustrations without gradients. Can have either single or multiple levels of transparency.</dd>

		<dt>GIF </dt>
		
		<dd>The GIF format is ideal for images with flat colors (no gradients) and hard edges, too. Common examples of these types of images are logos, logotypes, and illustrations without gradients.

		The GIF and PNG image formats use what is called "index-color". They store a minimized color palette in the image file and keys to where those colors should be located in the image. File size for GIF and PNG images is generally related to the number of colors used. Commons numbers of colors are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The GIF and PNG formats also both support transparency.</dd>

		<h2> Copyright </h2>

<!-- Questions 3,4,5,6 and 7 should be inside an article tag-->

	
	<h4>3. What is copyright?</h4>
	<p>Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. In copyright law, there are a lot of different types of works, including paintings, photographs, illustrations, musical compositions, sound recordings, computer programs, books, poems, blog posts, movies, architectural works, plays, and so much more!</p>

	<h4>4. What is Fair Use in terms of copyright? </h4>
	<p>Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances. Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides the statutory framework for determining whether something is a fair use and identifies certain types of uses—such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research—as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use.</p>

<a href = "https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/" > Read more here... </a>

	<h4>5. List 2 types of copyright licenses and what they are used for.</h4>
	<p>A license is a legal right to do something that you would not otherwise be permitted to do. The owner of a copyrighted work can authorize someone else to use the work by granting a license to the user. If no license has been given, the copyright owner can sue for the unauthorized use of the work, referred to as “infringement.” </p>

	<h5>Creative Commons (CC) licenses are public licenses</h5> 
	<p>You can use them to indicate what other people are allowed to do with your work. Each work is automatically protected by copyright, which means that others will need to ask permission from you as the copyright owner. There are six different Creative Commons (CC) licenses: </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>CC BY </li>
	<li>CC BY-SA </li>
	<li>CC BY-NC </li>
	<li>CC BY-ND </li>
	<li>CC BY-NC-SA </li>
	<li>CC BY-NC-ND </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>Copyleft</h5>
	<p>Is the practice of offering users of a work the right to freely distribute and modify the original work, but only under the condition that the derivative works be licensed with the same rights. Copyleft licenses are often found on software packages, but can be used on any work.Copyleft licenses give each person who possesses the work the same rights as the original author, including:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Freedom 0 – the freedom to use the work </li>
	<li>Freedom 1 – the freedom to study the work</li>
	<li>Freedom 2 – the freedom to copy and share the work with others</li>
	<li>Freedom 3 – the freedom to modify the work, and the freedom to distribute modified and therefore derivative works</li>
	
	</ol>

	<h4>6. How can you be sure you have permission to use an image.</h4> 
	<p> Before using any image, you need to check its copyright information: verify its original source, confirm by the owner whether you’re allowed to use it, and the terms involved in doing so. You can follow these steps in order to be sure about the image's permissions</p>
	
	<ol>
<li>Look for an image credit or contact details. </li>
<li>Look for a watermark </li>
<li>Check the image’s metadata</li>
<li>Do a Google reverse image search </li>
<li>Search the U.S. Copyright Office Database </li>

	</ol>

	<h4>7. List 3 websites where you can find images to use. <!--in link tags-->.</h4>
	<p>Unsplash has its own license, which essentially lets you use the images for free, in any way you like, except for using them to create a competing website.</p>
	
	<a href = "https://unsplash.com/" > Unsplash </a>
	
	<p>Pexels also has its own license, which states what you can and cannot do with the images. You can use and modify the images for free for both commercial and personal use without attribution.</p>
	
	<a href = "https://www.pexels.com/es-es/"> Pexels </a>
	
	<p>Free Images provides over 300,000 free stock images under its own license. The license allows a very broad range of uses, though it does list several restricted use cases (which are quite common for most free images sites).</p>

		<h2> Image optimization</h2>

<!-- Questions 8,9 and 10 should be inside an article tag -->

	<h4>8. What is image compression/optimization?</h4>
	<p>Image optimization is the process of creating and delivering high-quality images in the ideal format, size, and resolution to increase user engagement. It also involves accurately labeling images so search engine crawlers can read them and understand page context.</p>

	<h4>9. Why do we need to compress/optimize our images?</h4>
	<p>According to HTTP Archive, images made up on average 21% of a total web page’s weight as of November 2018. Because images consume more bytes than any other part of a website, their size and complexity heavily influence site performance.

	If you reduce the size of images without compromising quality, page load times improve and, subsequently, the experience of website visitors does too. An Aberdeen Group study shows that a one-second delay in load time equals a 7% drop in conversions, and that around 40% of people abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load.</p>
